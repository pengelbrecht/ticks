  "output": "I'll start by reading the current task and understanding what needs to be done.\n\nThe task is to add a 'board' case to main.go switch statement to route to cobracmd.ExecuteArgs and verify the command is accessible via 'tk board'.\n\nLet me first read the relevant files to understand the current structure.\n\nI can see that:\n\n1. The `board.go` file already exists with the full Cobra command implementation (created in the previous task 0gv).\n2. Looking at `main.go` line 50, I can see that `\"board\"` is **already included** in the switch case statement!\n3. Looking at line 94, `\"board\"` is also **already included** in the help text!\n\nThe routing is already complete. Let me verify this by checking if the command works and also check root.go for the ResetFlags function.\n\nThe command works. Let me see the full ResetFlags function to check if `boardPort` is already included.\n\nI can see from the grep output that `boardPort = 3000` is already in root.go line 305. Let me verify this by reading around that area:\n\nEverything is already complete. Let me run a quick test to verify the command works end-to-end:\n\nThe tests are passing. Let me run the full test suite to ensure everything is working:\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also verify the command is accessible via the main entry point (not just --help but actually running it):\n\nThe command is working correctly:\n- Returns exit code 3 (`ExitNoRepo`) when no `.tick` directory is found\n- Shows proper error message\n- Help is displayed\n\nNow let me verify the entire routing is in place by looking at what's been done:\n\n1. ✅ `board.go` - Created with full Cobra command implementation (done by previous task 0gv)\n2. ✅ `main.go` line 50 - `\"board\"` is already included in the switch case \n3. ✅ `main.go` line 94 - `\"board\"` is already in the help text\n4. ✅ `root.go` line 305 - `boardPort = 3000` is already in `ResetFlags()`\n\nThe task has been completed by the previous iteration (task 0gv). The `board` case was added to the Cobra routing when the command itself was created. Let me close this task and add a note.\n\nTask completed. The `board` command routing to Cobra was already implemented in the previous task (0gv). I verified that all pieces are in place:\n\n1. **main.go switch case (line 50)**: `\"board\"` is included in the list of commands routed to `cobracmd.ExecuteArgs`\n2. **main.go help text (line 94)**: `\"board\"` is listed in available commands\n3. **root.go ResetFlags() (line 305)**: `boardPort = 3000` resets the port flag between command executions\n4. **Command verification**: `tk board --help` works correctly, and the command returns proper exit codes (exit 3 when no `.tick` directory found)",
