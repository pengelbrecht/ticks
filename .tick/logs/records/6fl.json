  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding the current state of the codebase. Let me first read the relevant files to understand the existing implementation.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see that the `Awaiting` and `AwaitingAny` fields have **already been implemented** in the Filter struct (lines 22-29) along with the filtering logic in `Apply()` (lines 66-71) and the helper functions `matchesAwaiting()` and `matchesAwaitingAny()` (lines 77-100).\n\nThis was done by a previous iteration (88t) as noted in the epic notes:\n\u003e \"Completed 88t: Added comprehensive tests for query changes. Also implemented Awaiting and AwaitingAny filter fields in query.Filter struct with full backwards compatibility for Manual flag.\"\n\nLet me verify there are tests for this functionality and that everything is working correctly.\n\nExcellent! The implementation is complete with comprehensive tests. Let me run the tests to verify everything is working correctly.\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also run all the query tests to ensure nothing is broken.\n\nAll tests pass. The task is already complete - the Awaiting filter was implemented by a previous iteration (88t). Let me verify the acceptance criteria are met:\n\n1. ✅ **Awaiting field added to Filter struct** - Lines 22-26 in filter.go\n2. ✅ **AwaitingAny field added for multiple types** - Lines 27-29 in filter.go\n3. ✅ **Apply() handles Awaiting filter correctly** - Lines 66-68 in filter.go with `matchesAwaiting()` helper\n4. ✅ **Apply() handles AwaitingAny filter correctly** - Lines 69-71 in filter.go with `matchesAwaitingAny()` helper\n5. ✅ **Null/empty semantics work as specified** - Tested in filter_test.go\n\nThe implementation is complete with comprehensive tests covering all the semantics specified in the task. Now I need to close the task and commit.\n\nThe task has been closed. Now let me commit the changes and add an epic note.\n\nTask 6fl is complete. The Awaiting filter functionality was already implemented by a previous iteration (88t) as documented in the epic notes. The implementation includes:\n\n- `Awaiting *string` field - filters by awaiting type (nil = any, \"\" = none, value = specific)\n- `AwaitingAny []string` field - matches any of listed awaiting types\n- `matchesAwaiting()` and `matchesAwaitingAny()` helper functions in `Apply()`\n- Full backwards compatibility with `Manual=true` mapped to `awaiting=\"work\"`\n- Comprehensive test coverage in `filter_test.go`\n\nAll 24 query package tests pass.",
