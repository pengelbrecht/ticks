  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding the existing code, then implement comprehensive tests for verdict processing.\n\nLet me first read the existing verdict processing code and the test structure.\n\nNow let me check if there are any existing tests for verdict processing or similar tests I can reference.\n\nExcellent! I can see there are already comprehensive tests in place. Let me now review the task matrix from the task description to see what additional tests might be needed. Looking at the existing tests and comparing with the task requirements:\n\n**Existing coverage in verdict_test.go:**\n- ✅ No-op cases (nil verdict, nil awaiting)\n- ✅ All terminal states (work, approval, review, content) - both approved and rejected\n- ✅ All non-terminal states (input, escalation) - both approved and rejected\n- ✅ Checkpoint - both approved and rejected\n- ✅ Awaiting cleared after processing\n- ✅ Verdict cleared after processing\n- ✅ ClosedAt set when closing\n- ✅ Status changed to closed when closing\n- ✅ Error return is nil\n\n**Existing coverage in close_test.go:**\n- ✅ Close with requires=approval sets awaiting=approval\n- ✅ Close with requires=review sets awaiting=review\n- ✅ Close with requires=content sets awaiting=content\n- ✅ Requires persists through rejection cycle\n\nThe test coverage is already very comprehensive. However, let me verify if there are any edge cases or integration tests that should be added based on the task description. Let me check for any gaps:\n\n1. The verdict_test.go already tests all cells in the matrix\n2. But it doesn't explicitly test the combination of verdict processing + requires field together\n\nLet me add some additional tests that cover:\n1. Integration of ProcessVerdict with HandleClose (requires field handling during verdict processing)\n2. Ensure initial status is preserved in non-closing cases (not just `in_progress`)\n3. Add tests for ClosedAt not being modified on non-closing verdicts\n\nNow let me add comprehensive tests to cover additional scenarios. The existing tests are good but I'll add:\n1. Tests for the full workflow (verdict + requires integration)\n2. Tests for preserving existing ClosedAt (if somehow set already)\n3. Tests that verify the interaction between ProcessVerdict and HandleClose\n\nNow let me run the tests to make sure everything passes.\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also run the full test suite to make sure nothing is broken.\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me update the todos and close the task.\n\nTask completed. I added comprehensive verdict processing tests to `internal/tick/verdict_test.go`:\n\n**New tests added:**\n1. **TestProcessVerdictClosedAtTimestamp** - Verifies ClosedAt is set to a reasonable time\n2. **TestProcessVerdictPreservesOtherFields** - Ensures non-workflow fields aren't modified\n3. **TestProcessVerdictWithDifferentInitialStatuses** - Tests from `open` and `in_progress` states\n4. **TestProcessVerdictRequiresFieldNotAffected** - Confirms requires field persists through processing\n5. **TestProcessVerdictMatrix** - Documents all 14 awaiting+verdict combinations with descriptions\n6. **TestVerdictProcessingWorkflow** - Integration tests covering:\n   - `requires_approval` full cycle (route → approve → close)\n   - `requires_approval` rejection-retry cycle (route → reject → route again → approve)\n   - `requires_review` full cycle\n   - `requires_content` rejection behavior\n7. **TestProcessVerdictIdempotency** - Verifies multiple calls are safe\n\nAll tests pass. The test file now thoroughly covers the verdict processing state machine matrix and the integration with HandleClose for requires field handling.",
