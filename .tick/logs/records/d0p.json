  "output": "I'll start by understanding the current task and exploring the relevant codebase to implement the feature for removing boards from the cloud dashboard.\n\nThe exploration shows that the remove board feature is already partially implemented in the codebase. Let me check the current state of the modified files to understand what's already done and what remains.\n\nI can see that the feature has been fully implemented! Let me verify what exists:\n\n1. **auth.ts** (lines 330-346): `deleteBoard()` function that deletes a board from the database\n2. **index.ts** (lines 209-217): DELETE `/api/boards/:boardId` endpoint that calls `auth.deleteBoard()`\n3. **landing.ts**:\n   - CSS for `.board-remove` button (lines 122-133)\n   - HTML template includes the remove button (line 383)\n   - JavaScript `removeBoard()` function (lines 465-481)\n\nThe implementation is complete. Let me run tests to ensure everything works correctly.\n\nThe TypeScript compilation via wrangler works correctly (dry-run deployment passes). Let me verify the git diff to see what changes were made to these files.\n\nThe implementation is complete. Let me summarize what was implemented:\n\n**Backend (API):**\n1. `auth.ts`: Added `deleteBoard()` function that deletes a board from the database only if the user owns it\n2. `index.ts`: Added DELETE `/api/boards/:boardId` route that validates authentication and calls `deleteBoard()`\n\n**Frontend (Landing Page):**\n1. Added CSS for the \"remove\" button that appears on hover with a red highlight\n2. Updated board item template to include individual click handlers (so clicking \"remove\" doesn't open the board)\n3. Added `removeBoard()` JavaScript function with confirmation dialog\n\nNow I'll close the task and commit the changes.\n\nTask completed. Now let me add a note for future iterations.\n\nTask **[d0p] Cloud: Allow removing boards from dashboard list** is complete.\n\n**Summary of changes:**\n- **cloud/worker/src/auth.ts**: Added `deleteBoard()` function that deletes a board from the database with user ownership validation\n- **cloud/worker/src/index.ts**: Added DELETE `/api/boards/:boardId` route handler\n- **cloud/worker/src/landing.ts**: Added remove button UI (appears on hover, turns red), confirmation dialog, and `removeBoard()` JavaScript function\n\nThe feature allows users to remove old/offline boards from their dashboard. The removal is non-destructive - if an agent reconnects with the same token and board name, the board will be automatically re-registered.\n\n\u003cpromise\u003eCOMPLETE\u003c/promise\u003e",
