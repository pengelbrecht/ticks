  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the current task and understanding what's already been implemented. Looking at the epic notes, I can see that task [h81] (Responsive kanban board layout) was already completed in a previous iteration. Let me verify this.\n\nI see - the task was reopened with human feedback. The human suggests that on mobile, instead of just stacking columns, it would be better to have a menu to switch between column stacks. Let me look at the current implementation to understand what's there.\n\nLet me find the tickboard static files more specifically.\n\nLet me read the current implementation files to understand what's there.\n\nNow let me also read the app.js to understand the current JavaScript implementation.\n\nNow let me also look at the index.html to understand the full structure.\n\nNow I understand the current implementation and the human feedback. The human suggested that on mobile, instead of just stacking columns vertically, it would be better to have a **menu to switch between column stacks** (like tabs). This is a much better UX for mobile as:\n\n1. Users don't need to scroll through all columns\n2. They can quickly jump to the column they care about  \n3. Each column gets full screen width and height\n\nLet me create a todo list and implement this change.\n\nLet me implement the mobile column tabs. I'll add a tab bar that appears on mobile, allowing users to switch between columns.\n\nNow let me add the CSS for the mobile column tabs. I'll add this at the end of the mobile section in style.css, before the utility classes.\n\nNow I need to remove the old mobile vertical stacking CSS since we're replacing it with the tab-based approach. Let me find and update that section.\n\nNow let me add the JavaScript to handle mobile column switching. I'll add this to app.js in the mobile section.\n\nNow let me add the function to switch mobile columns and update the renderTicks function to handle mobile tab counts. First, let me add the switchMobileColumn function:\n\nNow let me update the renderTicks function to call updateMobileTabCounts with the counts and maintain the active mobile column:\n\nNow let me update the renderTicks function to also update mobile tab counts and maintain mobile active column:\n\nNow let me update the DOMContentLoaded to call initMobileColumnTabs:\n\nNow let me verify the implementation looks correct. Let me check if there are any tests to run.\n\nThere are some pre-existing test issues unrelated to my changes (the tests reference undefined constants). The cloud client tests mostly pass. My changes are CSS/JS/HTML only and don't affect the Go tests.\n\nLet me verify the syntax of the JavaScript is correct:\n\nJavaScript syntax is valid. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nNow let me commit these changes:\n\nNow let me add an epic note with context for future iterations:\n\nI have completed the task. Let me provide a summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nCompleted task **[h81] Responsive kanban board layout** by implementing a mobile column tabs system instead of vertical stacking, as suggested by the human feedback.\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **HTML** (`index.html`): Added a mobile column tabs bar with 5 buttons (Blocked, Queue, Active, Human, Done) containing icons, labels, and count badges.\n\n2. **CSS** (`style.css`):\n   - Replaced vertical stacking CSS with tab-based column switching\n   - Tabs only appear at `\u003c480px` breakpoint\n   - Only one column visible at a time via `.mobile-active` class\n   - Color-coded tabs and indicator lines per column type\n   - Touch-optimized sizing (min 44px targets)\n   - Column headers hidden on mobile (tabs serve as headers)\n\n3. **JavaScript** (`app.js`):\n   - Added `switchMobileColumn()` function to toggle active column\n   - Added `updateMobileTabCounts()` to sync tab badges with counts\n   - Added `initMobileColumnTabs()` to auto-select first non-empty column\n   - Updated `renderTicks()` to maintain mobile tab state after re-render\n\n### Why This is Better:\n- Users can quickly jump to any column without scrolling\n- Each column gets full viewport height for card scrolling\n- Tab bar provides at-a-glance counts for all columns\n- More intuitive UX for mobile users\n\n\u003cpromise\u003eCOMPLETE\u003c/promise\u003e",
