  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the current state of the tick.go file to understand what constants already exist and how they're structured.\n\nI can see that the constants have already been added by previous iterations (lines 26-48). The task also requests adding helper slices for validation (`ValidRequiresValues`, `ValidAwaitingValues`, `ValidVerdictValues`). These are not yet present in the file.\n\nLet me add the helper slices for validation. I'll add them after the constant definitions.\n\nNow let me run the tests to ensure everything still works.\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also add a quick test for the new helper slices to ensure they match the validation functions.\n\nThe tests already exist and use the constants. I should add a test to verify that the helper slices contain the correct values (matching the validation functions). Let me add tests for the Valid*Values slices.\n\nNow let me run all tests to ensure they pass.\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me close the task with a reason summary.\n\nNow let me commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add a note for future iterations.\n\nTask c91 is complete. I added the `ValidRequiresValues`, `ValidAwaitingValues`, and `ValidVerdictValues` helper slices to `internal/tick/tick.go`. The enum constants were already added by previous iterations as noted in the epic notes. I also added `TestValidValueSlices` to verify the slices contain the correct values matching the validation functions. All tests pass and changes have been committed.",
