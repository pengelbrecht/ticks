  "output": "I'll start by understanding the current task and exploring the codebase to find where the Kanban board handles the \"done\" column sorting.\n\nNow I understand the structure. The sorting is done in `app.js` and currently sorts by priority then ID. I need to modify it so that the \"Done\" column sorts by when tasks were closed (most recently closed on top).\n\nLet me read the relevant files to understand the data structure and implement the change.\n\nNow I can see the sorting logic. The current sorting in `renderTicks` (lines 798-807) sorts all columns by priority first, then by ID. I need to modify this so that the \"Done\" column sorts by `closed_at` timestamp instead (most recently closed on top).\n\nLet me check what data is available for ticks, particularly the `closed_at` field.\n\nGood, `closed_at` is available on ticks. Now let me check the server side to confirm the field is included in the API response for ticks.\n\nLet me check the Tick struct and the API response.\n\nThe `closed_at` field is already part of the Tick struct and will be included in the JSON response. Now I understand the structure. I need to modify the sorting logic in `app.js` to handle the \"Done\" column differently - sorting by `closed_at` descending (most recent first) instead of by priority.\n\nNow let me implement the change. I need to modify the sorting logic in `renderTicks` to:\n1. For the \"Done\" column: sort by `closed_at` descending (most recently closed on top)\n2. For other columns: keep the existing sort by priority then ID\n\nLet me verify the JavaScript syntax is correct by checking if there are any obvious issues with the file.\n\nThe JavaScript syntax is valid. Now let me also run any existing tests to make sure the change doesn't break anything.\n\nThe test failures are pre-existing issues unrelated to my change (they reference undefined column constants like `ColumnBacklog`, `ColumnInput`, `ColumnReview` which suggests the tests weren't updated after a previous refactoring). My JavaScript change doesn't affect Go code.\n\nLet me run a broader test to make sure there aren't issues I introduced.\n\nGood, the Go code builds. The test failures are pre-existing issues unrelated to my change.\n\nNow let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for context.\n\nLet me find the parent epic for task exu.\n\nThe task doesn't have a parent epic. Let me add a note to the task itself then.\n\nTask completed. Here's a summary:\n\n**Task [exu] - Kanban: sort done in order of when they were closed**\n\n**Solution:** Modified `renderTicks()` in `/internal/tickboard/server/static/app.js` to:\n1. Separate ticks into \"done\" and \"other\" groups\n2. Sort \"done\" ticks by `closed_at` timestamp descending (most recently closed on top)\n3. Sort other columns by priority then ID (unchanged behavior)\n4. Combine both groups for rendering\n\n**Files modified:**\n- `internal/tickboard/server/static/app.js` (lines 798-828)\n\n**Commit:** `bf5ee91` - feat(tickboard): Sort done column by closed date [exu]\n\n\u003cpromise\u003eCOMPLETE\u003c/promise\u003e",
