  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the existing code to understand the patterns used for other API endpoints, then implement the POST /api/ticks endpoint.\n\nNow let me read the tick store to understand how to create ticks:\n\nNow let me check the id generation code:\n\nNow let me look at the existing tests to understand the testing patterns:\n\nNow I have a good understanding of the patterns. Let me track this task and implement the POST /api/ticks endpoint.\n\nNow I need to understand how the routing works. Looking at the code, `/api/ticks` is handled by `handleListTicks` which only accepts GET. I need to modify this to also handle POST for creating ticks. Let me implement the create tick endpoint.\n\nNow I need to add the request/response types and the handler for creating ticks. Let me add these after the existing types:\n\nNow let me add the handleCreateTick handler at the end of the file:\n\nNow let me add the handleCreateTick function at the end of the file:\n\nLet me be more specific:\n\nNow let me update the todo and add tests for the new endpoint:\n\nNow let me add tests for the create tick endpoint. I need to find a good port number to use. Looking at the existing tests, they use ports starting from 18765. Let me add tests at the end of the test file:\n\nNow I need to update the existing test for method not allowed since we now accept both GET and POST:\n\nI need to update this test - POST is now allowed for creating ticks, but other methods like PUT and DELETE should be rejected:\n\nNow let's run the tests to make sure everything passes:\n\nAll the new tests pass. Now let's run all the server tests to make sure I haven't broken anything:\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also run the full test suite to make sure nothing else is broken:\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me update the todo and close the task:\n\nNow let me close the task:\n\nThe task is closed. Now let me commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for future iterations:\n\n\u003cpromise\u003eCOMPLETE\u003c/promise\u003e",
