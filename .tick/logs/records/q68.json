  "output": "Let me search for where this warning message originates and understand the cloud/WebSocket message handling.\n\nI can see the issue. The client sends a `register` message at line 335, but the message handling in `handleMessages()` at lines 421-440 doesn't have a case for `registered` - which is the expected response from the cloud server after a successful registration.\n\nThe switch statement handles `ping`, `request`, `error`, and then falls through to the default case for any other message type. When the cloud server sends back a `registered` confirmation message, it falls into the `default` case and produces the warning.\n\nLet me add handling for the `registered` message type:\n\nNow let me run the tests to make sure the change doesn't break anything:\n\nThere's a pre-existing test failure (unrelated to my change) - the test `TestLoadConfig_NoToken` is failing because a config file exists. Let me verify the code compiles correctly with my change:\n\nThe code compiles fine. The test failure is a pre-existing issue with the test environment, not related to my change. Let me also run the broader build to ensure everything is working:\n\nThe build error is in a different file and is a pre-existing issue, not related to my change. Let me verify my specific change is correct by building just the cloud package:\n\nThe cloud package builds successfully. The build error in `internal/ticks/client.go` is a pre-existing issue and not related to my task.\n\nNow let me close the task and commit the changes:\n\nNow let me commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for future iterations:\n\nThe task is complete. Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n## Summary\n\n**Issue**: Console showed `cloud: unknown message type: registered` warning when connecting to the tickboard.dev cloud service.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `internal/tickboard/cloud/client.go`, the client sends a `register` message when connecting (line 335), and the server responds with a `registered` confirmation message. However, the `handleMessages` function's switch statement (lines 421-440) had no case for the `registered` message type, causing it to fall through to the default case which prints the warning.\n\n**Fix**: Added a simple case handler for the `registered` message type at line 425:\n```go\ncase \"registered\":\n    // Registration confirmed by server - no action needed\n```\n\n**Files Modified**: `internal/tickboard/cloud/client.go` (3 lines added)",
