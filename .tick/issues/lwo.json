  "closed_reason": "Added live file tracking: WriteLive writes AgentStateSnapshot to .tick/logs/records/\u003ctick-id\u003e.live.json during runs, FinalizeLive renames to .json on completion. Engine StateCallback now wraps user callback to also write live files. Added LiveExists, DeleteLive helpers. Tests cover all new functionality.",

  "description": "Update engine to use agent.RunOpts.StateCallback to write current AgentStateSnapshot to .tick/runlog/\u003ctick-id\u003e.live.json on each state change. On run completion, call FinalizeLive() to convert to final .json. This enables tickboard to watch the file for real-time updates.",
