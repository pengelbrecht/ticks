  "title": "Fix tk merge to use parent branch",
  "description": "The tk merge command currently requires being on the main branch. It should use the ParentBranch from worktree metadata as the default merge target, enabling merges back to feature branches.",
  "notes": "2026-01-24 14:46 - Task xr2 completed: Updated cmd/tk/cmd/merge.go to use worktree ParentBranch as the merge target. The internal worktree.MergeManager already supported parent branch merging - this change updates the CLI command to leverage that. Tests in internal/worktree/merge_test.go already cover the parent branch scenarios comprehensively.",
