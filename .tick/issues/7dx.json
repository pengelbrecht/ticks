  "notes": "2026-01-20 08:47 - Summary: Performance testing complete. Build time: 1.6s (well under 10s target). Bundle size: 80.5KB gzipped (75.7KB JS + 4.8KB CSS), which is 10.5KB (15%) over the 70KB budget. Added comprehensive Performance section to README.md documenting metrics and optimization opportunities. The budget overage is primarily due to 19 Shoelace components (~55KB). For approval consideration: the bundle works correctly but exceeds the budget target. Options: (1) accept current size, (2) reduce Shoelace components, (3) implement code splitting.\n2026-01-20 07:47 - Work complete, awaiting approval",
