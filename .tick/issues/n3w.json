  "closed_reason": "Created cloud-e2e.sh that runs E2E tests against wrangler dev with real DOs. The script: (1) starts wrangler dev via wrangler-ctl.sh, (2) sets up test auth via setup-cloud-auth.sh, (3) starts test rig with --upstream pointing to wrangler dev, (4) waits for upstream connection, (5) runs cloud-specific tests including tick CRUD through DO, sync verification, and run stream subscription, (6) cleans up all processes on exit. Tests mirror comms-e2e.sh scenarios but verify full round-trip through the cloud stack."
