  "closed_reason": "Added GET /api/ticks/:id endpoint to server.go. Returns full tick JSON with notesList (parsed from Notes string with timestamp/author/text fields) and blockerDetails (ID, title, status for each blocker). Missing blockers are handled gracefully with placeholder values. Modified handleTickActions to route single-tick GET requests. Added parseNotes helper function and comprehensive tests."
