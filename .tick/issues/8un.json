  "description": "Migrate tk CLI to Cobra framework. Ticker already uses Cobra; adopting it in ticks provides a clean subcommand structure for run/resume/checkpoints/merge and removes manual flag plumbing.",
  "notes": "2026-01-17 22:39 - Iteration 1 complete: Created cmd/tk/cmd/ package with Cobra structure. Key files: root.go (rootCmd with SetVersion), version.go (example subcommand). main.go imports cmd package and syncs version in init(). Future tasks should add commands by creating new files in cmd/tk/cmd/ with init() functions that call rootCmd.AddCommand(). Note: TestRejectCommand was already failing before this work (pre-existing issue).\n2026-01-17 22:44 - Iteration 2 complete: Ported init and whoami commands to Cobra. Created init.go with --import-beads flag and whoami.go with --json flag. Added ExecuteArgs() to root.go to pass args from main.go's run() function. Used 'cobracmd' import alias in main.go to avoid shadowing the local 'cmd := args[1]' variable. Pattern: new Cobra commands go in cmd/tk/cmd/*.go, add to switch in main.go's run() with cobracmd.ExecuteArgs(args[1:]).",
