Task may be partially complete - review before continuing.\n2026-01-23 15:03 - Completed task kgi: Added Parallel Execution section to README.md (lines 310-350). Section placed after Dependency Graph section since they're related. Documented --parallel flag usage, git worktree isolation, the 5-step process, planning guidance with tk graph, and examples combining flags. Note: The code at cmd/tk/cmd/run.go:178-180 shows --parallel \u003e1 returns 'not yet implemented' error, but the infrastructure exists in internal/parallel.",
