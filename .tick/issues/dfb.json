  "description": "A local web server that displays ticks in a kanban board interface with human interaction capabilities (approve, reject, add notes). Server looks for .tick in current dir or takes path as argument.",
  "notes": "2026-01-16 10:25 - Completed qai (Core server with CLI). Key decisions: Used cobra for CLI (consistent with modern Go practices), embedded static files using go:embed, server uses context-based graceful shutdown. Static files in internal/tickboard/server/static/. Next tasks should add API endpoints to server.go and build out the frontend in static files.\n2026-01-16 10:28 - Completed hsg (API: List ticks with filters). The GET /api/ticks endpoint is in server.go. Uses query package for loading/filtering ticks. Response includes computed isBlocked and column fields. Column constants are ColumnBacklog, ColumnReady, etc. TickResponse struct embeds tick.Tick. Next tasks can add more API endpoints following this pattern.",
