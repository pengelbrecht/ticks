    "output": "I'll verify the `tk board` functionality as specified in the task. Let me start by understanding what's currently in place and then run the verification tests.\n\nNow let me set up a todo list to track my verification steps and check the current state:\n\nNow let me test that the server starts correctly. I'll run it in the background and check if it responds:\n\nThe server started successfully on port 3000 and returned HTTP 200. The error at the end is because the backgrounded process was trying to use the same port. Let me test the port flag:\n\nThe port flag works - server started on port 8081 and returned HTTP 200. The cloud sync also connected successfully (as shown by \"cloud: connected to wss://tickboard.dev/agent\").\n\nNow let me migrate the tests from cmd/tickboard/main_test.go to cmd/tk/cmd/board_test.go:\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also run the full cmd/tk/cmd test suite to ensure nothing else is broken:\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me verify the main.go routing is in place (as mentioned in the epic notes):\n\nThe board command is properly routed in main.go. Let me also verify the ResetFlags function includes boardPort:\n\nAll integration pieces are in place. Now let me clean up the build artifact and update the todo list:\n\nNow let me close the task and add a note. First, let me commit the test file:\n\nTask 5ws is complete. Here's a summary of what was verified:\n\n**Verification Results:**\n1. **Server starts on default port 3000** ✓ - HTTP 200 response received\n2. **Port flag works** ✓ - Tested with `--port 8081`, server responded correctly\n3. **Cloud sync works** ✓ - Connected successfully to `wss://tickboard.dev/agent`\n4. **Tests migrated** ✓ - Created `cmd/tk/cmd/board_test.go` with 3 tests for `findTickDir()`, all passing\n\n**Files created:**\n- `cmd/tk/cmd/board_test.go` - Tests for findTickDir function\n\nThe `tk board` command is fully functional with all the features from the standalone tickboard binary. The next task should delete the `cmd/tickboard/` directory to complete the migration.",
