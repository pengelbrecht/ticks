List all files in old static directory\n2. Verify each is replaced by new implementation\n3. Remove old files\n4. Update any references in Go code\n5. Run full build to verify nothing breaks\n\nTest: go build ./cmd/tk \u0026\u0026 ./tk board",
  "notes": "2026-01-20 08:38 - Summary: Removed empty internal/tickboard/static/ directory. This directory was from the old vanilla HTML/CSS/JS implementation and has been replaced by the Vite build output in internal/tickboard/server/static/. The Go server already references server/static via the embed directive on line 22 of server.go. Go build verified successful after removal. Risk: None - directory was already empty and unused.\n2026-01-20 07:38 - Work complete, awaiting approval",
