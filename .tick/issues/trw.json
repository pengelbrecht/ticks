Migrates run records from embedded 'run' field in tick JSON files to separate .tick/logs/records/\u003cid\u003e.json files, then removes the 'run' field. Includes --dry-run flag, comprehensive tests, and idempotent behavior (reports 'No migrations needed' when already migrated). Successfully migrated 101 existing run records.",
