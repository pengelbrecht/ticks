  "closed_reason": "Ported init and whoami commands to Cobra. Created cmd/tk/cmd/init.go with --import-beads flag and cmd/tk/cmd/whoami.go with --json flag. Added ExecuteArgs() to root.go for routing from main.go. Updated main.go import alias to cobracmd to avoid variable shadowing. Removed old runInit and runWhoami functions from main.go."
