    "output": "I'll work on updating the internal/checkpoint package to use `.tick/logs/checkpoints/` instead of `.ticker/checkpoints/`.\n\nLet me first examine the current checkpoint package to understand the structure.\n\nNow let me read the test file to understand the testing patterns used:\n\nNow I understand the structure. I need to update the default path from `.ticker/checkpoints` to `.tick/logs/checkpoints`. Let me also check how other packages (like runlog) were updated for reference:\n\nNow I understand the pattern. The runlog package uses `.tick/logs/runs/` as the new path. I need to update the checkpoint package to use `.tick/logs/checkpoints/`.\n\nLet me make the changes:\n\nNow I need to update the test file to expect the new path:\n\nNow let me run the tests to verify the changes:\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me also check if there are any usages of the checkpoint package that might need updating (such as comments referencing the old path):\n\nThere are references in documentation and tests. Let me check the git_verifier_test.go to see if this needs updating:\n\nI see - these tests are checking that `.ticker/checkpoints/` paths are excluded by the git verifier. Since we're migrating to `.tick/logs/checkpoints/`, the exclusion logic should be updated too. Let me check the actual filtering function:\n\nI see the issue. The `git_verifier.go` has `.ticker/` as an excluded path prefix. Let me check that file:\n\nThe `excludedPaths` already includes both `.tick/` and `.ticker/`. This means both the old and new checkpoint paths are already excluded since:\n- Old path `.ticker/checkpoints/` is covered by `.ticker/`\n- New path `.tick/logs/checkpoints/` is covered by `.tick/`\n\nSo the git verifier filtering should work correctly with the new path. The tests in `git_verifier_test.go` that mention `.ticker/checkpoints/` are actually testing that the old paths are excluded - these tests are still valid as they ensure backward compatibility for any `.ticker/` paths that might still exist.\n\nLet me run the full test suite to make sure everything is working:\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me close the task and commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for the next iteration:\n\nTask complete. I've updated the internal/checkpoint package to use `.tick/logs/checkpoints/` instead of `.ticker/checkpoints/`:\n\n**Changes made:**\n1. `internal/checkpoint/checkpoint.go:57` - Changed `NewManager()` default path from `.ticker/checkpoints` to `.tick/logs/checkpoints`\n2. `internal/checkpoint/checkpoint_test.go:16-17` - Updated test assertion to expect the new path\n\n**Key findings:**\n- The git verifier in `internal/verify/git_verifier.go` already excludes both `.tick/` and `.ticker/` paths, so filtering works correctly with the new checkpoint location\n- All 24 checkpoint tests pass with the new path",
