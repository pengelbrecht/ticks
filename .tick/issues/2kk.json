  "description": "Remove old static files, update documentation, run performance testing, ensure bundle size meets the 70KB gzipped budget.",
  "notes": "2026-01-20 08:38 - [hjp] Removed empty internal/tickboard/static/ directory. This was the old location for vanilla HTML/CSS/JS files - all were already migrated to Lit/Shoelace in the ui/ directory. The Vite build now outputs to server/static/ which is embedded in the Go binary. No code changes needed since the directory was already empty.\n2026-01-20 08:45 - Completed [ulo] documentation task: Created comprehensive README.md in ui/ directory with component architecture, dev setup, theming guide, and Shoelace reference. Updated main README.md with tk board command. Added JSDoc to all major components. pnpm install/build verified working.\n2026-01-20 08:47 - Performance testing [7dx] complete: Build time 1.6s (well under 10s). Bundle size 80.5KB gzipped is 10.5KB (15%) over 70KB budget - primarily due to 19 Shoelace components. Added Performance section to README.md with metrics and optimization opportunities. Ready for human approval to decide: accept current size or invest in optimization.",
