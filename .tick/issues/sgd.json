  "title": "Tickboard Lit/Shoelace Migration - Phase 1: Setup \u0026 Skeleton",
  "description": "Set up the Vite + Lit + TypeScript build pipeline and create the root tick-board component with Shoelace/Catppuccin theming. Target: working dev environment with styled empty board.",
  "notes": "2026-01-19 21:17 - Phase 1 task 5w6 complete: Build pipeline established at internal/tickboard/ui/. Key setup decisions: (1) vite-plugin-static-copy handles Shoelace icons to /shoelace/icons/. (2) PWA assets (favicons, manifest, sw.js) moved to ui/public/ so they survive emptyOutDir. (3) setBasePath('/shoelace') for production icon path. (4) Tick interface in src/types/tick.ts includes BoardTick with computed is_blocked/column fields. Next task should create tick-board component skeleton.\n2026-01-19 21:17 - Iteration 1 error: agent run: parse stream output: bufio.Scanner: token too long\n2026-01-19 21:21 - Phase 1 task p6k complete: Catppuccin theme configured. Created src/styles/catppuccin.css (Mocha palette) and src/styles/shoelace-theme.css (comprehensive Shoelace token overrides). Key details: (1) Uses CSS color-mix() for generating primary/success/warning/danger shades. (2) Neutral scale maps crust-\u003emantle-\u003ebase-\u003esurfaces-\u003eoverlays-\u003etext. (3) Test components added to index.html (buttons, input, badge) - remove these once tick-board component is implemented. (4) Import order in main.ts matters: dark.css first, then catppuccin.css, then shoelace-theme.css.\n2026-01-19 21:24 - Phase 1 task tcb complete: tick-board root component created. Key decisions: (1) @lit/context 1.1.6 added for state sharing via @provide/@consume pattern. (2) BoardState interface in board-context.ts includes ticks, epics, filters (selectedEpic, searchTerm), UI state (activeColumn, isMobile). (3) tick-board.ts has COLUMNS constant defining the 5 kanban columns (blocked/ready/agent/human/done) with colors/icons. (4) Component skeleton uses column placeholders - actual tick-column components will be added in future tasks. (5) Removed theme test components from index.html since tick-board now provides visible UI. (6) Media query listener handles isMobile state for responsive layout. Next task should create tick-column and tick-card components.\n2026-01-19 21:26 - Task gai complete: Minor fix to assetFileNames in vite.config.ts - changed from 'assets/[name]-[hash][extname]' to 'assets/app-[hash][extname]' so CSS bundle uses app- prefix (app-[hash].css) instead of index- prefix. Build pipeline was already fully functional from task 5w6. Output verified: index.html, assets/app-[hash].{js,css}, shoelace/icons/ with 2052 icons.\n2026-01-19 21:30 - Iteration 6 error: agent run: claude exited with error: exit status 1\nstderr:\n2026-01-19 21:30 - Iteration 7 error: agent run: claude exited with error: exit status 1\nstderr:",
