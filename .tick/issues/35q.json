    "output": "I'll work on this task to update the epic filter dropdown to show both the epic ID and title.\n\nLet me first find and read the relevant component file.\n\nThe epic filter is likely in either `tick-board.ts` or `tick-header.ts`. Let me search for \"epic filter\" or \"dropdown\" in these files.\n\nThe epic filter dropdown is in `tick-header.ts`. Let me read that file to see the current implementation.\n\nI can see the epic filter dropdown at lines 254-266. Currently, it only displays `${epic.title}`. The task requires showing both the epic ID and title, with the ID formatted differently (monospace, muted color).\n\nFor Shoelace's `sl-option`, I need to format the content to show the ID and title. Let me also check the mobile epic filter in `tick-board.ts` to ensure consistency.\n\nThere's also a mobile version in `tick-board.ts` at line 1064 that needs the same fix.\n\nNow let me implement the change. I'll format it as `\u003cspan class=\"epic-id\"\u003eid\u003c/span\u003e - title` where the ID is styled with monospace and muted color.\n\nNow let me update the template to show the epic ID and title:\n\nNow I need to update the mobile epic filter in `tick-board.ts` for consistency. Let me read the relevant section first.\n\nI need to add the same styling to the mobile filter dropdown and also add the CSS for `.epic-id` in tick-board.ts. Let me first check where the CSS styles are defined in tick-board.ts.\n\nLet me find a good spot to add the `.epic-id` CSS. I'll look for the end of the filter-drawer-content styles:\n\nNow update the mobile epic filter dropdown template:\n\nNow let me rebuild the UI to generate the new JavaScript assets. Let me check how to build the tickboard UI.\n\nThe build succeeded. Now I need to update the service worker cache version since we've updated assets with new hashes. As noted in the epic notes from [go3], the service worker cache version should be incremented when UI assets are rebuilt.\n\nWait, the cache versions are still at v2 but according to the epic notes, they were incremented to v3. Let me check the current state:\n\nI see there was a revert from v3 back to v2. Since we're building new assets, I need to increment to v4 to invalidate caches again.\n\nNow let me close the task:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic:\n\nNow let me commit the changes:\n\nTask completed. I've:\n\n1. **Updated tick-header.ts** (lines 77-85, 269-272): Added `.epic-id` CSS class with monospace font, muted color (`--subtext0`), and 0.85em font size. Updated the dropdown template to show `\u003cspan class=\"epic-id\"\u003e${epic.id}\u003c/span\u003e - ${epic.title}`. Also increased min-width from 180px to 220px to accommodate the longer text.\n\n2. **Updated tick-board.ts** (lines 111-115, 1070-1072): Added the same `.epic-id` CSS styling and updated the mobile filter drawer dropdown to match the desktop format.\n\n3. **Incremented service worker cache** to v4 in sw.js to ensure cloud deployments serve the new assets.\n\n4. **Rebuilt the UI** with `pnpm build` which generated new hashed asset files.",
