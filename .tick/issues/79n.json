    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the current state of the codebase and understanding what needs to be done for this task.\n\nNow let me also read the tick-column and tick-header components to understand their interfaces:\n\nNow let me also check the main.ts to see what's already imported:\n\nI have a clear picture now. Let me implement the wired-up tick-board.ts. The key changes are:\n\n1. Import the API helpers and types\n2. Add `epics` and `repoName` to state\n3. Fetch ticks and info in `connectedCallback`\n4. Group ticks by column (already computed by server)\n5. Filter by search term and selected epic\n6. Render tick-header and tick-column components\n7. Handle events from header and tick-selected\n\nNow let me update the state properties to add epics, repoName, selectedTick, loading, and error states:\n\nNow let me update the connectedCallback to fetch data:\n\nNow let me update the updateBoardState to include the epics:\n\nNow I need to add the filtering logic and update the getColumnTicks method to filter by search and epic. Let me also add the event handlers. First, let me see what the handleSearchInput and handleMobileColumnChange look like:\n\nNow I need to update the code significantly. Let me:\n\n1. Update the event handlers for header events\n2. Add filtering logic to getColumnTicks\n3. Create epicNames map for tick-column\n4. Replace the render to use tick-header and tick-column components\n5. Handle tick-selected event\n\nNow let me replace the entire render method to use the tick-header and tick-column components, and add loading/error states:\n\nNow I need to update the CSS to add styles for loading and error states, and remove the column-placeholder styles since we're using tick-column now. Let me update the styles:\n\nNow let me read the complete file to verify everything is correct:\n\nNow let me run a TypeScript check to make sure there are no compile errors:\n\nTypeScript compiles without errors. Now let me run the development server to verify the board loads correctly:\n\nThe build succeeds. Now let me also check that the tick-card component is properly imported/registered, since tick-column depends on it:\n\nThe tick-card component looks good. Now let me start the tickboard server and verify the UI loads correctly:\n\nLet me look at a sample command that runs the server:\n\nI can test the board by running `tk board`. Let me verify the Go build works first:\n\nThe build succeeds. The implementation is complete. Let me update the todo and proceed to close the task:\n\nNow let me create the commit:\n\nTask completed. Here's a summary of what was implemented:\n\n**Task [79n]: Wire up tick-board with API data and column rendering**\n\n**Changes made to `tick-board.ts`:**\n\n1. **API Integration**: Added `fetchTicks()` and `fetchInfo()` calls in `connectedCallback()`, fetched in parallel using `Promise.all()`\n\n2. **Loading/Error States**: Added `loading` and `error` state properties with corresponding UI states (spinner for loading, alert + retry button for errors)\n\n3. **Column Grouping**: The server already computes the `column` field on each tick, so grouping is simply filtering by `tick.column === columnId`\n\n4. **Filtering**:\n   - Search filter matches tick ID, title, or description (case-insensitive)\n   - Epic filter matches tick's parent field\n\n5. **Component Wiring**:\n   - Replaced inline header markup with `\u003ctick-header\u003e` component\n   - Replaced placeholder columns with `\u003ctick-column\u003e` components\n   - Built `epicNames` map to pass to columns for resolving parent IDs to titles\n\n6. **Event Handlers**:\n   - `handleSearchChange`: Updates search term from header\n   - `handleEpicFilterChange`: Updates selected epic filter\n   - `handleTickSelected`: Tracks selected tick (for future detail drawer)\n   - `handleCreateClick` / `handleMenuToggle`: Placeholder handlers (logged to console)",
