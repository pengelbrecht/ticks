The closable attribute was already present, but the close button was invisible due to missing color styling against the Catppuccin dark background. Added base color (--subtext0) and hover color (--text) for the close button.",

    "output": "I'll work on fixing the toast notifications missing close button issue. Let me start by examining the current implementation.\n\nNow I can see the issue. The `sl-alert` component has the `closable` attribute set (line 291), which should display a close button. As noted in the epic context, the issue is likely CSS - the close button may not be visible due to theme styling issues. The Shoelace close button needs explicit styling to be visible against the Catppuccin dark theme.\n\nLooking at the CSS, I can see that `::part(base)`, `::part(message)`, and `::part(icon)` are styled, but there's no styling for `::part(close-button)`. Let me add CSS to ensure the close button is visible.\n\nThe fix has been applied. Now let me verify the change by checking if there are any tests to run for this component.\n\nAs noted in the epic context, there are no test files for these components - testing is manual via the browser. Let me check if there's a build step or TypeScript compilation that should pass.\n\nLet me run the build to verify the TypeScript compiles correctly.\n\nThe build succeeds. Now let me close the task with the solution summary.\n\nNow let me commit the changes with the task ID in the message.\n\nNow let me commit the changes. I need to add the source file and the build output.\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations.\n\nTask complete. I fixed the toast notifications missing close button issue by adding CSS styling for the Shoelace alert close button. The `closable` attribute was already present on the `sl-alert` component, but the close button was invisible because there was no explicit color styling for `::part(close-button)` against the Catppuccin dark theme background. I added:\n\n1. Base color styling: `color: var(--subtext0)` for normal visibility\n2. Hover color styling: `color: var(--text)` for interactive feedback\n\nThe fix follows the existing pattern in the codebase where other Shoelace component parts (`::part(base)`, `::part(message)`, `::part(icon)`) are explicitly styled with Catppuccin theme variables.",
