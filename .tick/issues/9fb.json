  "description": "Update query logic to support agent-human workflow:\n- tk next excludes awaiting != null (agent mode)\n- tk next --awaiting returns tasks for humans\n- tk ready excludes awaiting != null\n- New filter options for awaiting field\n\nThis ensures ticker only picks up agent-ready tasks.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 18:28 - Completed nlt: Added IsAwaitingHuman() check in query.Ready() to exclude awaiting/manual ticks. The implementation uses the existing IsAwaitingHuman() helper from tick.go which handles both Awaiting field and legacy Manual flag. Test added to verify both cases.",
