    "output": "I'll start by examining the current state of the codebase to understand what needs to be done. Let me check if the `cmd/tickboard/` directory exists and what build scripts reference it.\n\nLet me check if any of these scripts reference the tickboard binary:\n\nGood, the install script only installs `tk`, not `tickboard`. Let me check the other scripts to be thorough:\n\nThe references to `tickboard` in the internal packages are for the tickboard.dev cloud service URL and configuration file - those need to stay. The only references that need to be removed are in `cmd/tickboard/`.\n\nLet me verify that the `tk board` command is working properly before deleting the old directory:\n\nThe `tk board` command is implemented and has tests. Let me verify the tests pass before deleting the old directory:\n\nTests pass. Now let me verify the `tk board` command is properly integrated by checking the help:\n\nExcellent! The command is working. Now I can safely delete the `cmd/tickboard/` directory. Let me also check if there are any other references to `cmd/tickboard` in the repo (e.g., in documentation or configuration):\n\nThe references in `.tick/` are issue tracking data that should remain. Let me check the docs file:\n\nThe docs file references the migration plan but doesn't need to be updated - it describes the migration phases and is still accurate since it says `cmd/tickboard/` was the source location, which is historical context. The task says to delete `cmd/tickboard/` after verification.\n\nNow I'll delete the `cmd/tickboard/` directory:\n\nThe directory is deleted. Now let me run the tests to ensure everything still works:\n\nTests are running. Let me wait for full results:\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also verify the build works:\n\nEverything works. Now I'll close the task:\n\nNow I'll create the commit:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for future iterations:\n\nTask completed. I deleted the `cmd/tickboard/` directory since all its functionality has been migrated to the `tk board` Cobra subcommand. Verified that:\n- Tests pass (`go test ./cmd/...`)\n- Build succeeds (`go build ./cmd/tk`)\n- `tk board --help` works correctly\n- No build scripts or Makefile referenced the tickboard binary",
