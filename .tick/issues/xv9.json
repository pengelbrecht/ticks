Added: (1) Run status polling to auto-detect active runs across epics, (2) SSE run stream connection for real-time updates, (3) Split-view layout with collapsible run panel alongside kanban board, (4) Wired run-output-pane, tool-activity, and run-metrics components into the panel, (5) 'r' keyboard shortcut to toggle run panel and Escape to close, (6) Live dot indicator when runs are active. Modified tick-board.ts and api/ticks.ts."
