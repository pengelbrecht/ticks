Change line 231 from Merge(wt) to Merge(wt, worktree.MergeOptions{})\n2. Update the message on line 230 from \"Merging to main...\" to use result.TargetBranch after merge\n   - e.g., \"Merged to \" + result.TargetBranch or similar\n\nNo new tests needed - existing parallel runner tests should still pass.",
